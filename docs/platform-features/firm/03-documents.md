- **Template Gallery**: A collection of pre-built, customizable document templates for common CRBI forms and contracts.
- **Workflow Builder**: A drag-and-drop interface for creating and managing document workflows, including approval chains and notifications.
- **Compliance Checker**: A dedicated section for running automated compliance scans on documents.
- **Document Viewer**: A secure, in-platform viewer for reviewing, annotating, and signing documents.

The interface uses a modern design with clear typography, color-coded status indicators (e.g., green for "Compliant," red for "Action Required"), and icons (e.g., a shield for compliance) to enhance usability. It is fully responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices.
