## How It Works in Practice

Picture this: you’re preparing a client’s application for Portugal’s residency program. With a single click in Compliance Tools, the system scans the submission. Moments later, a report highlights green checkmarks for verified items like proof of funds, a red flag for a missing health insurance document, and a suggestion to request it from the client. Once resolved, the tool confirms the application is compliant and submission-ready.

### Interacting with Compliance Tools

Compliance Tools act as a regulatory guardrail, ensuring applications are airtight. Here’s how they function in daily use:

1. **Running Compliance Checks**:
   - Select an application (e.g., Emma Brown’s Cyprus Citizenship) and click "Run New Check."
   - The system scans against jurisdiction-specific rules, producing a report:
     - **Green Checkmarks**: Valid passport, proof of funds.
     - **Red Flag**: Missing criminal background check.
     - **Yellow Warning**: Investment proof needs verification within 48 hours.
   - Suggested actions appear, such as "Request updated background check from client."

2. **Managing Alerts**:
   - A red alert card flags: "Liam Chen - Portugal Residency - Missing Health Insurance Document."
   - Clicking it opens a side panel with issue details and a "Send Reminder" button. After resolution, the action is logged (e.g., "Reminder sent - Oct 15, 2025, 10:32 AM").

3. **Accessing Regulatory Updates**:
   - The "Regulatory Updates" tab lists changes, such as "Malta updated investment threshold to €750,000 on Oct 1, 2025."
   - Details reveal affected applications (e.g., Ava Patel’s Malta application), with adjustment suggestions.

4. **Integrating with Payments**:
   - If a check flags an unpaid fee, the side panel links to "Payment and Invoice Management" to send an invoice (e.g., $2,000 for Emma’s application).
   - Payment confirmation updates the compliance status automatically.

5. **Audit Trail**:
   - The "Audit Logs" tab displays a timeline of actions (e.g., "Check run - Oct 14, 2025," "Issue resolved - Oct 15, 2025"), exportable as a PDF.

6. **Batch Processing**:
   - Select multiple applications and run a "Batch Check" to receive a consolidated report, updating each card’s status and saving significant time.
